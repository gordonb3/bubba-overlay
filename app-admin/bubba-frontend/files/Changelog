and create if needed

Upgrade package status to release

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-11-16

Moved bubba-diskmanager to /opt/bubba tree (commands changed)

Changed paths for File Transfer Daemon

Remove reference to Horde in userdel procedure

Let installer add and start bubba-adminphp service

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-11-16

Fixed wlanupdate page always timing out. The only time out that is still
occurring is when wifi is switched on or off. This is unavoidable and
will thus remain.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-11-13

Moved bubba-networkmanager to /opt/bubba tree (commands changed)

Fixed an issue with enabling/disabling automatic time updates
(service renamed)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-09-12

Sanitized handling of "null" configured NICs (i.e. NICs that do need to
be initialized because they are part of a bridge or a PPPoE connection
but should not receive address for themselves). The web UI will now
display these as having address 0.0.0.0 rather than "automatic" and you
can also set a NIC to "null" configuration by setting this address in
the web UI 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-09-07

Fixed creation of incorrect network conf entries when adapter is set
to use dhcp or "null"

Fixed race condition during changing of network parameters

Fixed incorrect display of firewall settings due to missing paths

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-09-02

Added debug USE flag to bubba-frontend to control whether php errors
should be shown to the user - as of now the default without this USE
flag is "not"

Fixed Tor service page

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-08-31

Fixed issue with apache vhost conf file

Added HDD temperature to the stat page, which I only discovered to be
missing today because it was originally added as an optional element
and thus did not throw any error or display invalid data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-08-25

Fixed issue with latest release of timezone-data (2015e) dropping the
part of the database that was referenced by bubba-backend.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-08-11

Fixed dnsmasq service tracker. Now properly showing service running
status and display of DHCP leases if applicable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-07-31

Fixed the wireless settings being blocked by interfaces not hardcoded in
bubba-networkmanager. Wireless interface still must be named according
to the old standards (i.e. wlan0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-07-24

Log file listing is now dynamically determined. Added some color scheming to the list as well, so it gets easier to identify what service a log file belongs to.

Fixed an issue with PHP 5.6 and HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-07-23

Fixed an issue with the delete user routine - you can't delete a samba
user if you already deleted the unix user.

Fixed the problem with the obsolete bubba-igd service

Printer service can now also be controlled - it was renamed from 'cups'
to 'cupsd'

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-07-22
We're moving to fpm because the old cgi method no longer works
with apache 2.4. Set requirement for apache to >=2.4.9, because we
want to use a unix socket rather than a tcp port.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-07-21
Fix entries in php include ini file

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-07-16
Fixed disk information view. Now properly recognizing system
partitions rather than rely on hardcoded Excito standards.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-07-07
Added first release
