Introduction
------------

Starting with version 28.0 forked-daapd was rebranded to OwnTone. Bubbagen was held back on version
26.4 for compatibility reasons, but now it is time to move forward. OwnTone is provided by the main
Gentoo repository, however it is only made available for the amd64 architecture so there are some
prerequisites for allowing it to be installed on the B3.

Action Required
---------------

If you do not use genup for your world updates you need to update app-admin/bubbagen first before
proceeding.

If you do use genup for world updates, then no further action is required.
